# CES Deep Learning Workshop


## 1, Environment prep, create an environment called "dlTorch"

Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section) (please use python 3.x, doesn't really matter, but I like 3) on your PC.  Use terminal to navigate to project folder
```
conda create --name dlTorch --file DL_workshop.txt 
```
  
## 2, Activate the environment we just created
```
conda activate dlTorch
```


## 3, Run the program
```
python3.6 cesShop.py
```


Accuracy should be around 99%
